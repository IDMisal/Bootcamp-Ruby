## Task
Ruby Quest06. This introduced the manipulation of CSV string files

## Description
-What is a CSV? :-)
It's a format that is used very often, Microsoft Excel uses it.
It's a 2d array: row and column.
Rows are separated by "line" (the character "
"). Columns are separated by ",". (Separators can be different, they can also be ";")
Your goal is to transform a string following the CSV format to a 2d array.
Your function will take two arguments, the contents of a CSV as a string and a separator.
Your function will return an array (line) of arrays (columns).
In this assignment, you will have to determine how to transform a string into an array.

We have been provided with a dataset of sales from My Online Coffee Shop. It's a CSV (Comma Separated Values) (each column is separated by , and each line is separated by  ).
Our goal will be to identify customers who are more likely to buy coffee online.
This time we will need to create a function with code logic, not just return the solution hard coded. :D
Data management is a hard problem. To better solve this hard problem, we will split them into smaller ones.
Here is our second step: data transformation. This exercise follows step one.
You will receive the output of your function my_data_transform.
Our function will group the data and it will become a Hash of hash. (Wow.)
Example:
"{'Gender': {'Male': 22, 'Female': 21}, 'Email': {'yahoo.com': 3, 'hotmail.com': 2}, ...}"
We will discard the column FirstName, LastName, UserName and Coffee Quantity from our output.

## Installation
