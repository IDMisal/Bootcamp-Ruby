## Task
Ruby Quest02
This quest introduce the use conditional statement, functions, loops and its syntax in ruby

## Description
if conditions are linked to else statements and writing the correct condition can be quite complicated :D.
-Your assignment is to write the correct conditions inside the if statements below in order to render the 2 print statements true!
-In order to "organize" your code, functions are the key. Let's dive in to functions!
-Repeating is annoying, which is why we could create a program for it. Implement a while loop to print 100 times "I want to code".
-Functions accept parameters. Let's send an integer to our function and print it!
-Functions can also return value(s) and the return value(s) can be used later on.
